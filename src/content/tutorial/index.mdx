# Building complex indicators

In this tutorial we show how to build a relatively complex,
yet well-known indicator. We take the example of the RSI
(aka Relative Strength Indicator),
and show how it is possible to construct this indicator
from elementary mathematical operations.

It turns out that RSI is natively supported by our tools,
but there are many technical indicators that are not.
On the other hand, elementary mathematical operations are all natively
supported; thus, it is possible to construct an infinite number of
indicators, whether well-known or personalized.

## Pre-requisite

For the record, we can refer to the definitions of the indicators (
[RSI](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/rsi.asp) and
[EMA](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/ema.asp)),
which are assumed to be known.

## Defining an RSI indicator

We observe that the definition of the RSI involves an exponential moving average.
Usually, the RSI is calculated with a period of 14. We therefore need
to determine the right period associated with the exponential average
(it is not 14!). We leave it to the reader to verify that this period
is given by the formula: _days = (smoothing \* period - 1)_

In this case, <i>2 x 14 - 1 = 27</i> since the smoothing used for
the exponential average is two.

It therefore follows that we can construct the RSI indicator as follows.
This will give the same result as if we had used the native indicator: `rsi( DJI, 14 )`.

indeed equals the built-in indicator.

    "DJI = ^DJI",
    "delta = DJI - previous(DJI,1)",
    "AverageGain = ema( max(delta, 0), 27)",
    "AverageLoss = ema( -min(delta, 0), 27)",
    "MyRSI = 100 * AverageGain / ( AverageLoss + AverageGain )",
    "BuiltinRSI = rsi( DJI, 14 )"
  ],
